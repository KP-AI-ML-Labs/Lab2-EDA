## 📖 Story Point  
Now that we have clean data, let’s find the patterns. What does a typical T20 innings look like? Who are the star performers?

## 🎓 Mapping to Lecture  
- **Topic:** Data Preprocessing  
- **Python Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Category:** Data Analysis & Visualization

## 🧪 In-Class Practical  

**Objective:**  
Visualize key aspects of the innings to derive initial insights.  

**Tasks:**  
1. Load the cleaned CSV from Lab 1  
2. Create a bar chart of Runs Scored by each batsman  
3. Create a scatter plot of Balls Faced vs. Runs Scored to visualize strike rates  
4. Generate a histogram of the runs scored to understand the distribution

## 🏡 Home Task  
- Use the `wormAndManhattan` data from the original JSON  
- Parse the comma-separated strings to create a DataFrame showing overNumber, runsInOver, and cumulativeScore  
- Create a line plot for the cumulative score (a "Worm" graph)

## ✅ Deliverable  
A notebook containing at least **3 distinct visualizations** with proper titles and labels.
